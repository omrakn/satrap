# Spatial Analyst of Transportation Performance -- SATRAP

SATRAP quantifies and illustrates centrality and accessibility metrics of a road network. The software is designed as an independent GIS software that can calculate transportation performance metrics with an all-round open source approach. Users can obtain, analyze and visualize open source spatial data without handling any technical difficulties with SATRAP. It targets policy makers and researchers who want to analyze a road network's geometric and topologic properties with its easy-to-use interface.
