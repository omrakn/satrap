# Spatial Analyst of Transportation Performance -- SATRAP

SATRAP quantifies and illustrates the centrality and accessibility metrics of a road network. The software is designed as an independent GIS software that can calculate transportation performance metrics with an all-round open-source approach. Users can obtain, analyze and visualize open source spatial data without handling any technical difficulties with SATRAP. It targets policy makers and researchers who want to analyze a road network's geometric and topologic properties with its easy-to-use interface.

# To Start SATRAP

The software must be opened from an environment having the required libraries. Environment file (pygis.yml) in this repository can be easily created with the following command in Anaconda Command Prompt or cmd:

>conda env create -f pygis.yml

After the environment is created, the following command must be executed to use the environment:

>conda activate pygis

After these processes, satrap.py can be opened via prompt screen from pygis environment.

>python satrap.py
